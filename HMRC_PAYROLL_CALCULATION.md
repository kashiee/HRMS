# HMRC-Approved Payroll Calculation Formula

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive HMRC-approved payroll calculation system implemented in the HRMS application. The system follows UK tax regulations for the 2024/25 tax year and includes all mandatory deductions and contributions.

## Core Calculation Formula

### 1. Gross Pay Calculation
```
Gross Pay = Basic Pay + Overtime Pay + Bonus Pay + Other Pay
```

### 2. PAYE Tax Calculation (Income Tax)

#### Tax Bands 2024/25
- **Personal Allowance**: £12,570 (tax-free)
- **Basic Rate (20%)**: £12,571 to £50,270
- **Higher Rate (40%)**: £50,271 to £125,140
- **Additional Rate (45%)**: Over £125,140

#### Tax Code Handling
- **1257L**: Standard personal allowance (£12,570)
- **BR**: Basic rate (20% on all earnings)
- **D0**: Higher rate (40% on all earnings)
- **D1**: Additional rate (45% on all earnings)
- **NT**: No tax
- **S1257L**: Scottish rates (using same rates for PoC)

#### Calculation Method
```
Annual Taxable Income = Annual Salary - Personal Allowance

Basic Rate Tax = min(Taxable Income, £50,270 - £12,570) × 20%
Higher Rate Tax = min(Taxable Income - (£50,270 - £12,570), £125,140 - £50,270) × 40%
Additional Rate Tax = (Taxable Income - (£125,140 - £12,570)) × 45%

Monthly Tax = Annual Tax ÷ 12
```

### 3. National Insurance Contributions

#### NI Rates 2024/25
- **Employee Rate**: 12% on £12,570 to £50,270
- **Employee Higher Rate**: 2% on earnings over £50,270
- **Employer Rate**: 13.8% on earnings over £9,100

#### Employee NI Calculation
```
Monthly Salary = Annual Salary ÷ 12
Primary Threshold Monthly = £12,570 ÷ 12 = £1,047.50
Upper Earnings Limit Monthly = £50,270 ÷ 12 = £4,189.17

If Monthly Salary > £1,047.50:
    Basic NI = min(Monthly Salary - £1,047.50, £4,189.17 - £1,047.50) × 12%
    
    If Monthly Salary > £4,189.17:
        Higher NI = (Monthly Salary - £4,189.17) × 2%
```

#### Employer NI Calculation
```
Employer Threshold Monthly = £9,100 ÷ 12 = £758.33

If Monthly Salary > £758.33:
    Employer NI = (Monthly Salary - £758.33) × 13.8%
```

### 4. Pension Contributions

#### Auto-Enrolment Requirements 2024/25
- **Employee Minimum**: 5%
- **Employer Minimum**: 3%
- **Total Minimum**: 8%

#### HMRC-Approved Pension Schemes
1. **Auto-Enrolment Workplace Pension**
2. **NEST (National Employment Savings Trust)**
3. **The People's Pension**
4. **Smart Pension**
5. **Aviva Workplace Pension**
6. **Royal London Workplace Pension**
7. **Scottish Widows Workplace Pension**
8. **Legal & General Workplace Pension**
9. **Aegon Workplace Pension**
10. **Standard Life Workplace Pension**

#### Calculation Method
```
Employee Pension = Gross Pay × Employee Rate (typically 5%)
Employer Pension = Gross Pay × Employer Rate (typically 3%)
```

### 5. Student Loan Repayments

#### Repayment Thresholds 2024/25
- **Plan 1**: £22,015 annually
- **Plan 2**: £27,295 annually
- **Plan 4**: £27,660 annually
- **Plan 5**: £25,000 annually

#### Calculation Method
```
Monthly Threshold = Annual Threshold ÷ 12
Repayment Rate = 9%

If Monthly Gross Pay > Monthly Threshold:
    Student Loan = (Monthly Gross Pay - Monthly Threshold) × 9%
```

### 6. Net Pay Calculation

```
Net Pay = Gross Pay - PAYE Tax - NI Contributions - Pension Contributions - Student Loan - Other Deductions
```

### 7. Employer Costs

```
Total Employer Cost = Gross Pay + Employer NI + Employer Pension
```

## Complete Calculation Example

### Employee Details
- **Annual Salary**: £35,000
- **Tax Code**: 1257L
- **Pension Scheme**: Auto-Enrolment
- **Student Loan**: Plan 2

### Monthly Calculation
```
Monthly Salary = £35,000 ÷ 12 = £2,916.67

1. PAYE Tax:
   Personal Allowance = £12,570
   Annual Taxable Income = £35,000 - £12,570 = £22,430
   Tax = £22,430 × 20% = £4,486
   Monthly Tax = £4,486 ÷ 12 = £373.83

2. NI Contributions:
   Monthly Salary > £1,047.50
   Basic NI = (£2,916.67 - £1,047.50) × 12% = £224.30

3. Pension Contributions:
   Employee Pension = £2,916.67 × 5% = £145.83
   Employer Pension = £2,916.67 × 3% = £87.50

4. Student Loan:
   Monthly Threshold = £27,295 ÷ 12 = £2,274.58
   £2,916.67 > £2,274.58
   Student Loan = (£2,916.67 - £2,274.58) × 9% = £57.79

5. Net Pay:
   Net Pay = £2,916.67 - £373.83 - £224.30 - £145.83 - £57.79 = £2,114.92

6. Employer Costs:
   Employer NI = (£2,916.67 - £758.33) × 13.8% = £297.85
   Total Employer Cost = £2,916.67 + £297.85 + £87.50 = £3,302.02
```
